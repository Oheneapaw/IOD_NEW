Delayed peace efforts due to this event would probably get several thousands more killed and injured, Israeli, Palestinian or otherwise.\n",

As for ponchos, this one is a bit rare to see as it’s not really commonly used in Malaysia. So I’d say a raincoat is better.

      "Comment Body: I kinda quoted Anwar Ibrahim (something about things didnt make sense as its against economic principles) but did you not keep up with the USD:MYR depreciation stories from earlier this year?  If you stop doomscrolling for a bit, just look at the bigger picture for the past couple of years at least. Our economy [grew at a rate of 4.2% in the first quarter of this year amidst strong private expenditure, strong export growth, higher household spending, and continued growth in employment and wages](https://www.disruptionbanking.com/2024/05/21/what-explains-the-weakness-of-the-malaysian-ringgit-myr/). The article was in May and there are similar stories about weakened Ringgit (especially post 1MDB) and a lot of things happened since then. Fact is, Malaysia benefited more from the dumbass american-made trade war and we are always being pressured to pick a side and  we just did. But the bigger picture right now, the west decision to seize russian assets spooked a lot of people and had unintended side effect. We're just stuck in between pissing contests but ultimately we're in better ground.\n",

If anything it would benefit the US, it being the party that's far away. So why would we or China want something as strong as a defense treaty? US presence and behavior in the region, often a stabilizing force in some contexts but also a destabilizing one in other contexts, is a threat to China mainly and that invites Chinese response mainly in the form of pressure against US allies (the Philippines) and strengthened ties with more-or-less neutral countries like us. We and everyone knows this, which explains why we behave the way we do.\n",

His audience might be Malay, and in that case it could be interpreted as implying Malay PH voters as not knowing the history of May 13 as he knows it. In this case it is a criticism and not hate speech. Of course his version of May 13 might be different than yours - different part of our society perceives it differently. And I dare say it is govt policy of banning these discussion (or at least strongly discouraged it for the sake of \"racial unity\") that prohibited us to move forward with an understanding of that incident as a country.\n",

      "Comment Body: While I do agree that there is a “dengki” culture in Malays and I hate the meleleh trend as much as the next normal person. The accusations that popped up was very valid with video evidence. It wasn’t baseless. He was caught on camera pouring from a bottle of rice wine directly into the claypot rice. After it went viral he changed the bottle to sesame oil. I think Muslims should be careful and not trust this guy. If you want to eat go ahead but don’t just paint the rest of us as “dengki” if we say that you should be careful eating there.\n",

      "Comment Body: Regardless that a lot of people might have higher personal taxes, which is a citizen duty anyway, the tax rate in Malaysia is still very low. Besides that, I think business owners have higher chance of dodging income tax than the workers. The workers actually are the one hurting more even if they have to pay another 2-5% on higher income tax since the business owners are able to hide their income under current system and create even higher income inequality. \n",

      "Parents often just associate higher academics with good prospects and unfortunately push children within the remits of their financial standings to pursue any open door. However, not all open doors lead to accredited, substantive, career-advancing programmes. It's not even higher ed these days either; so many poyo posh kindergartens/taska, international schools nowadays left right and centre too.\n",

      "I think more needs to be done either by KPM or maybe SPA idk to vet and regulate private education institutions in terms of not just the validity of programmes/curriculum they design and sell. At the same time, I think parents and students also ought to do the bare minimum of thoroughly researching courses/studies before commiting to them instead of blinding trusting some billboard/brochure. The notion of the more you pay = the better outcomes, or even just the fact that you're willing to part with so much money = you are exempt from being scammed.
